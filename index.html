        <h1>For My Caveman🌼🫶🏻</h1>
        <p>When did my feelings change, idk🫠<br>
        When did that platonic love changed into this, idk🙃<br>
        When did fear of even touching someone change into this constant urge to hug you my caveman, idk😅🙈<br>
        When those teasing terms become endearments, idk🤭<br>
        When did your espresso eyes become the serene forest I wish to get lost in, idk😩<br>
        When did I become greedy to become the only little fury to exist for you, idk👉🏻👈🏻<br>
        When did your goofy smile become the reason I want to wake up every morning, idk😁<br>
        When did your existence become more calming than the ocean itself, idk✨🌻<br>
        When did you become the home I longed for, idk🫤<br>
        When did my excuses n escape plans turned into lets try this together, idk🥲<br>
        Why all my idks changed into try for u, idk💕💖<br>
        I ask myself how, when, why — yet the answers slip away😗😪<br>
        Is this what they call love? idk😅<br>
        Is this what they call love? idk🙂<br>
        But if it is love, I hope you see it, my caveman🤲🏻🫀<br>
        Cause your little fury's heart only yearns for you!!🧚🏼‍♀️</p>
